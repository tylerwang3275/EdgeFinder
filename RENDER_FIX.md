# ðŸ”§ Fix for EdgeFinder Data Loading Issue

## âœ… **Problem Identified & Fixed**

The issue was that your EdgeFinder was using **incorrect sport keys** for TheOddsAPI. The API expects keys like `baseball_mlb` but we were using `mlb`.

## ðŸš€ **Solution Applied**

I've fixed the sport keys in the code and pushed the update to GitHub. Now you need to update your Render environment variables.

## ðŸ“‹ **Steps to Fix Your Live App**

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard
1. Open [render.com](https://render.com) and sign in
2. Find your **"edgefinder"** service
3. Click on it to open the service details

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
1. Go to the **"Environment"** tab
2. Update the `SPORTS_FILTER` variable:

**Current (incorrect):**
```
SPORTS_FILTER = mlb,nfl,nba,nhl,soccer
```

**New (correct):**
```
SPORTS_FILTER = baseball_mlb,americanfootball_nfl,basketball_nba,icehockey_nhl,soccer_epl
```

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. After updating the environment variable, Render will automatically redeploy
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for the deployment to complete

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results**

After the fix, your EdgeFinder at [https://edgefinder-czi3.onrender.com/](https://edgefinder-czi3.onrender.com/) should show:

- âœ… **Real MLB games** (including Seattle Mariners vs Toronto Blue Jays!)
- âœ… **Live betting odds** from multiple sportsbooks
- âœ… **Discrepancy analysis** between prediction markets and sportsbooks
- âœ… **Seattle hometown picks** section
- âœ… **Auto-refreshing data** every 5 minutes

## ðŸ§ª **Test Your Fix**

Once redeployed, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://edgefinder-czi3.onrender.com/health

# API endpoint (should return real data now)
curl https://edgefinder-czi3.onrender.com/api/latest

# Web interface
# Open: https://edgefinder-czi3.onrender.com
```

## ðŸŽ‰ **What You'll See**

Your EdgeFinder will now display:
- **Seattle Mariners vs Toronto Blue Jays** (MLB)
- **Live odds** from DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, etc.
- **Prediction market discrepancies**
- **Seattle hometown analysis**
- **Professional betting edge analysis**

## ðŸ†˜ **If Still Not Working**

If you still don't see data after the fix:

1. **Check Render logs** for any error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Wait a few minutes** for the deployment to fully complete
4. **Try refreshing** the web page

**Your EdgeFinder should be fully functional after this fix! ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ**
